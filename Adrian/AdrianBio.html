    <h1>Adrian Adioetomo </h1>
    <h2>by Phil Schuller</h2>
  
    <p >
        Adrian plays resonator guitar with a slide. This means that he can slide up and down
        the neck of the guitar, and mix in crazy licks with his free fingers, Fasten 
        your seatbelts,
        
        </p>

    <p>
        Part of Adrian is dark. I think he understands the truth of what Robert Johnson and 
        Son House et al were singing about maybe better than anyone. Another part of Adrian is a very 
        lighted hearted beautiul Dude. This is why we love him.
    </p>

    <p>
        At a Robert Johnson festival in the namesakes hometown a few years back. Adrian
        stepped up on an open mic stage and was tipped $300 by the appreciative and
        astonished crowd.

    <p> In Indonsia he won the equivaliant of a Grammy for his EP. You can look it up.
